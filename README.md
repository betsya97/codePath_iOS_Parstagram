## Notes
Part 1 of Parstagram introduced the Parse iOS library which handled the database behind the app. The database would host the user's name, password, and posts. Previous knowledge from Twitter and Yelpy App was utilized in this app. Part 2 of Parstagram introduced another cocoapods library called MessageInputBar. Interestingly, this library repurposed iOS features in order to build comment fields.
